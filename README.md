Kit Patcher is a lightweight and user-friendly game launcher which offers
essential features such as real-time server status checking, game file installation and
updates, patch notes, menus, and seamless game launching. Players can easily stay
informed about server news and availability, download the latest updates, and access
patch notes and other menus before launching the game

This was originally designed as a closed environment dev tool for installing and updating a 
game client within a private group or studio. It will need some additional work to function as a commercial type tool. See roadmap. 

Dependencies included in this package. If it's an issue then please reach out to me. 

IF USING UNITY 6, DELETE THE TEXTMESH PRO EXTRAS FOLDER TO FIX OUT OF BOX ERRORS.
